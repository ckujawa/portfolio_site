  After hearing about Sanity.io quite often, I decided to give it a try on a new
  blog project. Here are my first impressions...

Ok. Ok. After hearing about Sanity.io from the fine hosts of the [Syntax podcast](https://syntax.fm) (one of my favorites!) and starting into it through a course that I'm working through (yeah...a bit of a fan boy. What can I say? Those two are great!) I decided to use it (Sanity) on a project I decided I wanted to start today. \
\
The project? A quick blog to discuss my adventures as I focus on getting back into triathlon shape again after being away from the sport for oh...13 years. Yep...family and career took precedent. But family (i.e. kids) have grown and flown the coop and the career took a turn for the better (i.e. I'm not commuting two hours one way and working 8-10+ hours a day)--so I can entertain the idea of getting back in to a sport I loved. But this is not about that. I'll be blogging about my experience building a new blog with Gatsby (my favorite static site generator) and Sanity. \
\
So after deciding to blog my journey back to fitness, I started poking around the internet. I'm using Strapi for another project, so I considered using that. I've also wanted to dive in to Next for a while now, but have yet to have the opportunity to (after all, I've been using Gatsby for 2 years so why??). But I started to search for blog posts on using Next with Sanity and ended up at [Sanity's starter site page](https://create.sanity.io/) . There were a bunch of starter options that fit a variety of needs laid out in a clean, readable deisgn:

So after a bit of exploring, I chose to stick with what I know and use Gatsby/Netlify. I clicked on that starter and was pleasantly surprised to find that instead of a page of endless text with commands sprinkled through they had a tool to help bootstrap my site:

Well that makes life easy...and I like easy when it comes to getting started with new tech. So I filled out the 3 step process and was  presented with the result: A link to my Sanity management console with all the details I need, a newly created git repo with the commands to get started, a link to Sanity Studio and a deploy had started to Netlify. The only thing I'm unsure of in that whole mix is the deploy to Netlify, since I'm not one to publicly deploy half-baked projects, but overall I'd say that my early experience with Sanity is that it's pretty darned slick. I can't wait to get into this more and see what it has to offer!\

Until next time...
