I built this custom Wordpress theme for Debbie as she was about to launch her first book. She wanted to be able to use the site to advertise and sell her book, and potentially more in the future. The site also featured a FAQ page and a calendar that would allow her to share speaking engagements, books signings, and other public events as she booked them.
